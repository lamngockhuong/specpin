# Specpin

**Specpin pins business specifications (rules, descriptions, acceptance criteria) directly onto the elements of a running web UI. It is NOT a spec-driven code generator** (unrelated to GitHub Spec Kit / OpenSpec): it does not generate application code from specs. It is a knowledge layer that attaches living, Git-versioned documentation onto interfaces you already have. The interface already knows where everything is; Specpin gives it a memory.

Specs live as JSON inside the consumer repo's `.specs/` directory, are linked to elements through resilient fingerprints, and render in-browser through pluggable display modes (tooltip, sidebar, and more). Everything is local-first and Git-native: versioned, reviewable via PR, and diffable.

## How it fits together

```
.specs/ (in your repo)  -->  specpin serve (Go sidecar, localhost HTTP + SSE)  -->  browser extension (match + render)
```

1. `specpin init` scaffolds `.specs/manifest.json` in your repo.
2. `specpin serve` exposes `.specs/` over a token-authenticated localhost HTTP API with live-reload (SSE).
3. The browser extension connects to the sidecar, matches each spec's fingerprint against the live DOM, and renders the spec on its element.

## Toolchain

- Node >= 20, pnpm 10, Turborepo
- Go 1.26 (sidecar CLI)
- Vitest (all TS packages)

## Workspace scripts

```bash
pnpm install        # install workspace deps
pnpm build          # turbo run build across packages
pnpm test           # turbo run test (vitest per package)
pnpm lint           # eslint flat config
pnpm typecheck      # tsc --noEmit per package
```

## Status

Phase 1 MVP. Demoable end-to-end: a Go sidecar serves `.specs/`, and the WXT extension matches fingerprints and renders specs (tooltip + sidebar) with manual capture. Deferred to 1.1: FileSystem/Manual sources, hybrid fingerprint scoring, the remaining renderers, Safari packaging, and `specpin generate` (AI).
